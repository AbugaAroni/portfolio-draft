    <h2> About me</h2>


    <p> I've done many things, and worn many different hats over the years.
    I've always focus on projects and jobs where I can learn new skills and expand on old ones too.
   I think the following sums up my background best:</p>
<br>
   <p>I'm a Aviation graduate with a passion for technology and longboarding and have spent sa considerable amount
     of time after graduation learning about SEO, SEM and pursuing my passion for IT.
      I completed a DBIT program at Strathmore University, and I'm polishing my developer skills now at the Moringa school intro course.
    Finally, I also work as a content writer and have my own niche blog - downhill254.com.
      I am extremely committed to pursuing my passions and overcoming any challenges that present themselves. </p>
